    "A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure, devised by Burton Howard Bloom (1970),\n",
    "used to determine whether an element is in a set. Imagine you're part of a team designing an antivirus software package. Your task is to alert the user when she is about to enter a known and potentially malicious website. What is a quick and efficent way for you to notify the user? A simple method to achieve your task would be to create a list of all the known and potentially harmful websites. Each time the user tries to go to a website, you could search to see if that website is in your list. This method becomes prohibitively inefficient when you have a large list of websites. It would take too much memory and too much time to search through the list. An alternative way of achieving the same goal is to use a Bloom filter. A Bloom filter is an array of ones and zeros that is used to determine if an element *may be* in a set or is *definitiely not* in the set.\n",

    "Now we want to populate our Bloom filter with websites we know are malicious. To do this, we need to determine how many hash functions we want to use. The elements we're looking for are website names (strings). A hash function is a function that maps those strings to numbers. In our case, we will use those numbers to map the string to one of the indexes of our array.  Moreover, the hash functions are constructed in such a way that it is reasonable to assume the number produced for a string is random and uniformly distributed over the set of values.  For our example, if \"virus.net\" is an input string, we want a hash function to map the string to a number from 0 to 49 with all possibilities having equal probability. Since we're doing a small example, let's just use two hash functions. For each website, each hash function will map the string to a number from 0 to 49. We will set the Bloom filter to one at each of those positions. We can use the hashlib module for our hash functions. We will use the SHA and MD5 functions, though what they do is a little beyond the scope of this course."

    "To understand these questions we need to go into a little bit of theory and here is where the probability comes into play. Let $m$ be the number of bits in the array, $n$ be the number of elements in our list, and $k$ be the number of hash functions we will use. We can determine the probability that we get a false positive. We assume that the hash functions are uniformly distributed, i.e. any array position in the Bloom filter is selected with equal probability.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus the probability that a certain bit is one is: $P\\{b=1\\}=1-(1-\\frac{1}{m})^{kn}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A false positive would then occur if all the $k$ bits are one (each of the hash functions maps to a one). So the probability of a false positive is $P\\{false \\ \\ positive\\}=\\left[1-(1-\\frac{1}{m})^{kn}\\right]^k.$\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes independence of the bits being set to one which is only approximately true, but in general is a pretty good approximation to the probability of a false positive. We can also use the concept that the large $n,$  small $p$ limit of the binomial distribution\n",
    "is the Poisson distribution with paramter $np$ to further approximate:\n",
    "$P\\{false \\ \\ positive\\}=[1-(1-\\frac{1}{m})^{kn}]^k \\approx (1-e^{-\\frac{kn}{m}})^k$\n",
    "\n",
    "This should reveal some intuitive notions. The probability of a false positive increases as the number of elements in the list ($n$) increases and decreases as the number of bits in the filter ($m$) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we wanted to minimize the probability of a false positive with respect to $k$ (the number of hash functions we're using). From calculus, we can find an optimal value of $k$ in terms of $m$ and $n$. I skip the derivation here, but you can do it on your own as an exercise. The value of $k$ that minimizes the probability of a false positive is given by $k=\\frac{m}{n}\\ln{2}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also find the required number of bits for the Bloom filter to ensure a given probability of false positives. Let $p$ be the probability of a false positive and assume that we are using the optimal number $k=\\frac{m}{n}\\ln{2}$ of hash functions. We get:\n",

    "Historically, being able to compute binomial probabilities was one of the most important applications of the central limit theorem. Binomial probabilities with a small value for $n$ (say, 20) were displayed in a table in a book. To calculate the probabilities with large values of $n$, you had to use the binomial formula, which could be very complicated. Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution simplified the process. To compute the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, take a simple random sample from a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (number of trials) and $p$ (probability of success in each trial) can be approximated by a normal distribution when $n$ is large enough, and $p$ is not too close to 0 or 1. The mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ of the approximating normal distribution are $np$ and $np(1−p)$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>**<SPAN style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #C0C0C0\">Problem 3:</SPAN>** Select three different sets of parameters (n, p) for the binomial distribution to explore. One set should have a small $n$ = 10, one with a medium $n$ = 50, and one with a large $n$ = 100. For each $n$, choose $p$ = 0.1. For each (n, p) pair, plot the binomial distribution's PMF and the corresponding normal approximation's PDF on the same graph.\n",

Document A was the original text, document B was an example of plagiarism, and document C was an example of acceptable paraphrasing. You now have a very rudimentary method for checking for plagiarism. If you were the history professor in the example, you would be able to quantify the similarity among papers and more efficiently be able to check across a large number of papers. If you feel like it, use this code on other paraphrased quotes and papers. "
